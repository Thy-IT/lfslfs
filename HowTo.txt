LFSLFS -> Lazy Full Scripted LFS -> Lazzy Full Scripted Linux From Scratch

Based on Anton Video LFS :: https://youtu.be/VSBkJ3rj-X4

Build Linux From Scratch can be a great and time consuming learning experience.

However Not everybody have the time to copy/paste all the commands.

All the heavy lifting will be done by the shell scripts and you can just enjoy and see all the processing.

The scripts are divided in phases.

1) Requirements to  build enviornment
    Virtual Box
    Boot XUbuntu Live ISO
    setup xubuntu user password
    Install & Start SSH Server
    Install screen and some other required dependencies for the Build.
    Download and Verify all the LFS Sources.
    
2) Simple Shell Script (2) will create the first part of the temp File System
      Basically just copy/paste the shell script
      chmod 755 lfslfs_2.sh
      ./lfslfs_2.sh
      
3) Once chroot ... the script (3) will be in charge of uncompress, build, test and install your system
      Basically just copy/paste the shell script
      chmod 755 lfslfs_3.sh
      ./lfslfs_3.sh

4) Final Touches to wrap the installation. and boot the new system.

5) Posible work on script to finish a X Graphical installation with different window manager.
